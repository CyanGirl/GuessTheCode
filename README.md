# Guess The Code

## About

This is a small Game made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This also marks my first Javascript project and hence, a simple one.
In this, one has to guess the Code of 4 digits that has already been selected by the CPU. Not only, the correct digits matter, but also, the digits have to be placed at correct places. At each move, Hints will be provided with how many digits have been guessed correctly and how many of them are placed at correct positions.
